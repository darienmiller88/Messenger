## This is a react implementation of my previous messenger clone I made last year.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
* [Netlify](https://bit.ly/3q4pcJz)

### Requirements
* Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/Messenger`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `go build` to create a root level `Messenger.exe` file, and then run `.\Messenger` to run the executable. If an executable is not needed, simply input `go run main.go` instead, or `.\fresh` to enable a server restart on change.
* `cd` into the `client` folder, and run `npm start` to the react server, which should be on port 3000
